# Critical Infrastructure Monitoring Framework  

The **Critical Infrastructure Monitoring Framework (CIMF)** is designed to ensure the availability, reliability, and performance of essential enterprise services such as web portals, VPNs, firewalls, and service tools. It continuously monitors infrastructure health, detects failures, logs performance metrics, and triggers real-time alerts when predefined thresholds are breached.  

## üöÄ Features  
‚úÖ **Automated Infrastructure Monitoring**: Tracks uptime, response time, network latency, DNS resolution, and packet loss.  
‚úÖ **Real-time Alerts**: Sends notifications when critical issues are detected.  
‚úÖ **Database Logging**: Stores monitoring results in a MySQL database for analysis.  
‚úÖ **Scalable & Extensible**: Supports additional monitoring checks like SSL validation and service health checks.
